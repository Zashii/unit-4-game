This is a game where you can pick one of four characters to battle with the other 3. 

The player does more and more damage as he attacks!

The enemy does a fixed amount of damage per attack.

The results of each combat turn is shown in the combat log at the bottom.

After the player wins the battle, he does not heal back up. He must continue battling until he has defeated all enemies to win.

If an enemy's HP drops to 0, the player wins and moves on to defeat the next enemy. If all enemies have defeated, you win the game.

If the player's HP drops to 0, you lose the game.
